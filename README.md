# Paper Plane, a Unity-based iOS game

This is a game that I am in the process of making for the iOS App Store. I always wanted to make a game reminiscient of old arcade-ey high score driven games, and this is what I came up with. I am using C# to script, Adobe Photoshop to create the sprites, Logic Pro X/Audacity for sound design, and Unity as the game engine.
